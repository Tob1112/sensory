This Software is the controller for a wireless controlled robot by WiFi technology 
that is capable of moving freely and carrying objects, using the built-on robotic arm.
The prototype is a compilation of three main parts, the first part consists of the car 
with the flexible body for modification and addition with heavy wheels that is represented 
in predator tracks for more stability, movements are managed by two types of motors, servo-motor 
for steering and brushless-motor for acceleration. The second part is the Robotic arm that is made up of 
nineteen metal segments and six servo-motors to give three joints with rotating base and the final end is
a catcher driven by gestures using “Leap Motion Controller”. The third part is the Sensors which
provide the user with the work environment state. This is represented in the following: temperature,
humidity, objects distance “front - back” sides, smoke, flammable gases, flame, the machine balance 
and finally a live video stream camera for vision, also it includes a lighting lamps and a buzzer.
